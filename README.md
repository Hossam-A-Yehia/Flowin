 │    ├── manifest.json
 │    ├── triggers/
 │    ├── actions/
 │    └── schema.ts
 ├── notion/
 ├── whatsapp/
```

### manifest.json Example
```json
{
  "id": "google_sheets",
  "name": "Google Sheets",
  "category": "Productivity",
  "auth": "oauth2",
  "triggers": ["new_row", "sheet_updated"],
  "actions": ["add_row", "update_row"]
}
```

```javascript
{
  id: 'add_row',
  name: 'Add Row to Sheet',
  inputFields: [
    { id: 'sheet_id', type: 'string', required: true },
    { id: 'values', type: 'object', required: true }
  ],

5. Log every step with status + payload.
6. Handle errors → retry 3x or mark failed.
7. Send notification (if enabled).
8. Store summary in PostgreSQL.

### Worker System:
- **Redis channels:** `flow:queue`, `flow:retry`, `flow:failed`
- **Max concurrency:** configurable (per plan)
- **Rate-limited requests** to integrations

### How It Works:
1. **User types:**
   "When I get a new Shopify order, send WhatsApp message to the client."
2. **Flowin parses** it using intent + entities detection.
3. **The AI maps** triggers and actions automatically.

### Internal Prompt Template:
```
User goal: {user_text}
Output: JSON of trigger + actions formatted for Flow Builder
Rules:
- Always include trigger + actions
- Use official integration names
- Avoid ambiguous steps
```

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "trigger": "shopify.new_order",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "whatsapp.send_message", "message": "Hello {{customer_name}}" }
  ]
}
```

### AI Safety & Guardrails:
- Input validation (Zod schema)
- Reject unsafe or ambiguous commands
- Logs every AI-generated flow with review flag
- Optional human approval for enterprise users

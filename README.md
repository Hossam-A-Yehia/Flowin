### 🔄 Core User Flows (Step-by-Step)

#### 4.1 Sign-Up / Authentication Flow

**Steps:**
1. User lands on `/signup`.
2. Chooses:

#### 4.2 Connecting First App

1. User clicks **"Integrations" → "+ Connect App."**
2. Selects from available integrations (e.g., Gmail, Notion).
3. System opens OAuth or API Key modal.
4. Connection success message:
   > "✅ Google Sheets connected successfully!"
5. Dashboard updates with "Active Integrations: 1"

**Edge Cases:**
- Invalid token → Show "Connection failed. Reauthorize?"
- Rate limit → "Please wait 60s before reconnecting."

#### 4.3 Creating the First Flow (Manual Builder)

**Step-by-Step:**
1. User clicks "Create New Flow."
2. Flow name modal appears → "Order Confirmation Flow."
3. Opens the **Flow Builder Canvas**.
4. Adds a **Trigger Node**:
   - "When a new order is created in Shopify."
5. Adds an **Action Node**:
   - "Send WhatsApp message to the client."
6. Connects nodes visually (drag and drop).
7. Configures message template using variables:
   `"Hello {{customer_name}}, your order #{{order_id}} has been received!"`
8. Clicks "Test Run."
9. Gets visual success checkmark.

**UI Elements:**

2. Suggests flow visually:
   - [Trigger] Shopify Order Created
   - [Action] WhatsApp Message
3. User clicks "Apply Flow."
4. System automatically creates nodes with correct config.
5. Tooltip: "This flow saves ~15 minutes per task."

**AI UX Design:**
- Inline chat panel on the right.
- Suggestions appear as cards: "Try this next" or "Add delay between actions."

#### 4.5 Testing & Running the Flow

### Folder Structure
```
integrations/
 ├── google_sheets/
 │    ├── manifest.json
 │    ├── triggers/
 │    ├── actions/
 │    └── schema.ts
 ├── notion/
 ├── whatsapp/
```

### manifest.json Example
```json
{
  "id": "google_sheets",
  "name": "Google Sheets",
  "category": "Productivity",
  "auth": "oauth2",
  "triggers": ["new_row", "sheet_updated"],
  "actions": ["add_row", "update_row"]
}
```

  ],
  outputExample: { success: true, rowId: 'abc123' }
}
```

---

## 🔄 20. Flow Execution Lifecycle

### Step-by-Step:
1. Trigger fires (Webhook / Poll / Scheduler).
2. Flow Worker dequeues job from Redis.
3. Fetch input data from the trigger node.
4. Execute each action node sequentially.
5. Log every step with status + payload.
6. Handle errors → retry 3x or mark failed.
7. Send notification (if enabled).
8. Store summary in PostgreSQL.

### Worker System:
- **Redis channels:** `flow:queue`, `flow:retry`, `flow:failed`
- **Max concurrency:** configurable (per plan)
- **Rate-limited requests** to integrations

---

## 🧠 21. AI System Behavior & Prompt Logic

### How It Works:
1. **User types:**
   "When I get a new Shopify order, send WhatsApp message to the client."
2. **Flowin parses** it using intent + entities detection.
3. **The AI maps** triggers and actions automatically.

### Internal Prompt Template:
```
User goal: {user_text}
Output: JSON of trigger + actions formatted for Flow Builder
Rules:
- Always include trigger + actions
- Use official integration names
- Avoid ambiguous steps
```

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "trigger": "shopify.new_order",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "whatsapp.send_message", "message": "Hello {{customer_name}}" }
  ]
}
```

### AI Safety & Guardrails:
- Input validation (Zod schema)
- Reject unsafe or ambiguous commands
- Logs every AI-generated flow with review flag
- Optional human approval for enterprise users
